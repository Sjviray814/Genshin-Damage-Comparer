# Genshin-Damage-Comparer

Hello! You can use this calculator in order to test your genshin builds and see which ones are better than others.  Don't be intimidated by the code, I'll explain everything to you step by step.

Also, make sure you have genshin open because you are gonna need to collect some data in-game.



1. First, this should be self-explanatory but have this open in another tab so you can read these directions while you do stuff.
2. Open the file titled calculator.js and copy the text from line 1 all the way to the end (should be forty something lines iirc)
3. Go to a javascript compiler online, the one I am using in this tutorial is https://www.programiz.com/javascript/online-compiler/ but you can use whatever you want.  If you know how to run the js file someway else, you can use that.
4. Delete all of the text on the left side under where it says main.js, the left side should be completely blank now.
5. Paste the text that you copied in step 2 into the left side where you just deleted the text.
6. Read the steps that I wrote in the text that you just pasted to continue, you will need genshin to be open and you will need to find your damage when you crit and when you don't crit for each build.  Make sure you use the same talent, hits and buffs when you are finding the numbers.  This varies from character to character but try to use whatever is that character's main source of damage.  For example, if you are testing hu tao, find her crit and non crit vape charge attack.  If you are testing Keqing builds, you can use her E or her Q damage or even her normal/charge atks.
7. When you find these numbers, look inside the text you just pasted for further instructions.
8. When you are finished, press the blue run button at the top of the screen (or run the file another way if you want)
9. Whichever number is higher is the set that does more damage.



Disclaimer:


This calculator does not take into account buffs that need to be stacked (mistsplitter passive, eula q, etc.) so make sure the buffs remain constant throughout. 

Also, this calculator is meant to compare only 1 talent or attack so it doesn't take into account the full dps of your character.  If you're running something like 2pc noblesse on a character but only testing normal attacks, it won't be an accurate representation of which set gives more dps for the overall kit, just which set gives more dps when normal attacking.

Finally, even if an artifact set has more overall dps but you like the playstyle of another set better, play what is more fun for you.  Playing a more fun set will lead to more overall enjoyment than a 5% dps increase (Shime for example can be more dps for hu tao if subs are good but if you like using her Q then run crimson).
